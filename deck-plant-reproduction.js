    // Key Words (page 1)
    ["Asexual reproduction", "Reproduction involving only one parent that produces genetically identical offspring (clones)."],
    ["Cutting", "A piece of plant cut from a parent plant and made to form roots and shoots in favourable conditions."],
    ["Fertilisation", "The fusion of male and female gametes."],
    ["Gamete", "A male or female sex cell."],
    ["Germination", "In plants, the growth from a seed after a period of dormancy."],
    ["Nectar", "A sugary liquid which attracts pollinating animals to a flower."],
    ["Pollen", "The male plant sex cell."],
    ["Runners", "Side branches with plantlets that can grow into a new plant; some plants reproduce asexually this way."],
    ["Sexual reproduction", "Reproduction where male and female gametes fuse at fertilisation to produce genetically different offspring."],

    // Parts of a Flower + Roles (page 1 table)
    ["Anther", "Produces male sex cells (pollen grains)."],
    ["Filament", "A stalk-like structure that supports the anther."],
    ["Stamen", "The male part of a flower consisting of an anther held up on a filament."],
    ["Carpel", "The female reproductive part of the flower (ovary, ovule, style and stigma)."],
    ["Ovary", "Produces female sex cells (eggs)."],
    ["Ovule", "Develops into a seed after fertilisation."],
    ["Stigma", "Top of the female part of the flower; sticky so pollen grains stick to it."],
    ["Style", "Tube connecting the stigma to the ovary which pollen travels down."],
    ["Petal", "May be brightly coloured to attract insects."],
    ["Sepal", "Protects the flower before it opens; often green."],

    // Adaptations for Pollination (page 1 comparison)
    ["Insect-pollinated: petals", "Bright petals with a sweet smell to attract insects."],
    ["Wind-pollinated: petals", "No petals or small green/brown petals (no need to attract insects)."],
    ["Insect-pollinated: stigma/anther position", "Stigma and anther are inside the flower."],
    ["Wind-pollinated: anther position", "Anther hangs loosely out of the plant so wind can blow pollen away easily."],
    ["Insect-pollinated: stigma", "Stigma is sticky so pollen carried by insects sticks to it."],
    ["Wind-pollinated: stigma position", "Stigma hangs outside of the plant to catch pollen on the wind."],
    ["Wind-pollinated: stigma surface", "Stigma may be feathery or sticky to catch pollen blown by the wind."],
    ["Insect-pollinated: pollen", "Pollen grains are larger and sticky so fewer pollen grains need to be produced."],
    ["Wind-pollinated: pollen amount", "Produces large amounts of pollen to increase chances of reaching another plant."],
    ["Wind-pollinated: pollen mass", "Pollen has a low mass so it can be blown far on the wind."],
    ["Insect-pollinated: anthers", "Anthers are firm and rigid so insects brush against them."],
    ["Insect-pollinated: nectar", "Often contains nectar to attract insects (bees may use nectar to make honey)."],

    // Seed Dispersal (page 2 table)
    ["Animal dispersal (external)", "Seeds stick to animals' fur and are transported to a different location (e.g., burrs/goose grass)."],
    ["External dispersal adaptations", "Hooks/spikes to hook onto fur OR sticky coating to stick to animals."],

    ["Animal dispersal (internal)", "Seeds in fruits are eaten; seeds pass through digestion and are deposited elsewhere in faeces (e.g., plums/strawberries)."],
    ["Internal dispersal adaptations", "Fruit is brightly coloured and edible; seed is small and often protected by a hard case."],

    ["Drop and roll", "Ripe nuts/fruits fall and roll away from the parent plant (e.g., apples/acorns)."],
    ["Drop and roll adaptations", "Round fruits roll further; tall trees increase impact force; heavy fruits/nuts drop due to gravity."],

    ["Explosion dispersal", "Pods (e.g., peas) can explode and eject seeds when they dry unevenly."],
    ["Explosion trigger", "One side of the pod dries faster, causing it to buckle, split open and eject seeds."],

    ["Water dispersal", "Seeds/fruits fall into water and are carried away (e.g., coconuts)."],
    ["Water dispersal adaptations", "Low density so they float; can sometimes also be transported by wind."],

    ["Wind dispersal", "Seeds are carried away by wind (e.g., dandelions, sycamore seeds)."],
    ["Dandelion adaptations", "Feathers/fluff act as parachutes; seeds are very light; large surface area catches wind."],
    ["Sycamore adaptations", "Wings provide large surface area; twist/turn in wind; work best released high up in windy conditions."]
