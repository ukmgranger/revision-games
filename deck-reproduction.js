    // Core definitions
    ["Puberty", "A period of time when a person becomes sexually mature; changes happen because of hormones."],
    ["Hormone", "A chemical produced in the body and released into the bloodstream to send messages."],
    ["Biological sex", "Determined by reproductive organs, sex chromosomes, and hormone levels."],
    ["Male (biological sex)", "Typically produces sperm cells, has XY chromosomes, and higher testosterone."],
    ["Female (biological sex)", "Typically produces egg cells, has XX chromosomes, and higher oestrogen."],
    ["Oestrogen", "Main female reproductive hormone; involved in thickening the uterus lining."],
    ["Testosterone", "Main male reproductive hormone; stimulates sperm production."],
    ["Egg cell", "The female sex cell, produced by the ovaries."],
    ["Sperm cell", "The male sex cell, produced by the testes."],
    ["Conception", "The process of becoming pregnant."],
    ["Embryo", "Unborn offspring in early development (up to end of 8th week after conception)."],
    ["Foetus", "Unborn offspring after embryo stage (from the 8th week after conception)."],
    ["Gamete", "A sex cell."],
    ["Fertilisation", "Fusion of male and female gametes."],
    ["Zygote", "A fertilised egg cell."],

    // Male reproductive system (parts & functions)
    ["Penis", "Allows urine and semen to pass out of the male’s body."],
    ["Testis", "Produces sperm cells and releases the male sex hormone testosterone."],
    ["Urethra", "Tube that carries urine and semen; has a ring of muscle to keep fluids separate."],
    ["Scrotum", "A bag of skin that contains the testes."],
    ["Gland", "Produces fluids that mix with sperm cells to make semen."],
    ["Sperm duct", "Carries sperm cells from the testes to the urethra."],

    // Female reproductive system (parts & functions)
    ["Vagina", "A muscular tube that leads from the cervix to the outside of the body."],
    ["Cervix", "Ring of muscle at the lower end of the uterus; keeps the baby in place during pregnancy."],
    ["Ovary", "Contains undeveloped egg cells; each month an egg matures and is released."],
    ["Uterus", "Where the baby develops during pregnancy."],
    ["Oviduct", "Carries egg cells from the ovaries to the uterus."],
    ["Uterus lining", "Blood-rich tissue where an embryo implants; lost each month during menstruation."],
    ["Vulva", "The external female genitals."],

    // Puberty changes (examples from organiser)
    ["Puberty: both sexes", "Pubic/underarm hair, growth spurts, acne, stronger body odour, mood changes, sexual feelings."],
    ["Puberty: males", "Voice deepens, facial hair grows, shoulders broaden, increased muscle growth; testes produce sperm; penis/testes grow."],
    ["Puberty: females", "Breasts develop, hips widen, menstrual cycle starts, vaginal discharge is produced."],

    // Menstrual cycle timeline (28 days average)
    ["Menstrual cycle", "Monthly cycle of changes in ovaries and uterus lining to prepare for fertilisation (average 28 days)."],
    ["Menstruation", "Releasing blood and tissue from the uterus lining; also known as a period."],
    ["Ovulation", "Release of a mature egg cell from an ovary."],
    ["Cycle day 1–5", "Uterus lining breaks down and leaves via vagina (menstruation)."],
    ["Cycle day 5–14", "Uterus lining builds up; an egg cell matures in the ovary."],
    ["Cycle day 14", "Egg cell released from the ovary (ovulation)."],
    ["Cycle day 14–28", "Uterus lining remains thick; egg may be fertilised by a sperm cell."],
    ["Cycle day 28", "If egg not fertilised, uterus lining breaks down and the cycle repeats."],

    // Pregnancy structures + terms
    ["Gestation", "Time between conception and birth during which the baby develops in the uterus (average 40 weeks)."],
    ["Implantation", "Attachment of the embryo to the lining of the uterus at the start of pregnancy."],
    ["Placenta", "Organ in uterus that transfers oxygen/glucose to foetus and removes waste."],
    ["Umbilical cord", "Connects the placenta to the foetus."],
    ["Semen", "Mixture of sperm cells and fluid released during ejaculation in males."],
    ["Ejaculation", "Release of semen from the penis."],
    ["Sexual intercourse", "Sexual contact involving penetration (e.g., insertion of penis into vagina)."],
    ["Miscarriage", "Death of a foetus before 24 weeks of pregnancy."],
    ["Stillbirth", "Birth of a baby that died in the uterus after 24 weeks of pregnancy."],
    ["Offspring", "The children or young of an organism."],

    // Fertilisation / reproduction steps
    ["Step 1 (reproduction)", "Semen containing sperm cells is ejaculated into the vagina."],
    ["Step 2 (reproduction)", "Sperm travel through the female system to meet an egg cell in the oviduct."],
    ["Step 3 (reproduction)", "One sperm penetrates the egg membrane; nuclei fuse (fertilisation)."],
    ["After fertilisation", "Zygote divides to form an embryo that implants in the uterus lining."],

    // Sperm adaptations
    ["Acrosome", "Cap on sperm head releasing enzymes to digest the egg cell membrane."],
    ["Sperm nucleus", "Contains genetic information from the father (half the genetic information)."],
    ["Midpiece mitochondria", "Many mitochondria release energy for movement."],
    ["Flagellum (tail)", "Allows sperm to swim towards the egg cell."],

    // Egg adaptations
    ["Egg membrane change", "After fertilisation, the membrane changes so no more sperm can enter."],
    ["Egg nucleus", "Contains genetic information from the mother (half the genetic information)."],
    ["Egg cytoplasm", "Contains nutrients to support the embryo after fertilisation."],
    ["Large egg size", "Increases chance of fertilisation and allows more space for nutrients."],

    // Development milestones (weeks)
    ["Week 4–6", "Embryo ~6mm; heart and organs start to form; heart begins to beat."],
    ["Week 8–9", "Arms grow; toes/eyelids form; embryo is now called a foetus."],
    ["Week 12", "Foetus fully formed; organs/muscles/bones in place; ~60mm; starts moving."],
    ["Week 20–24", "Foetus ~250mm; kicks; can hear; swallows amniotic fluid; produces urine; fingerprints formed."],
    ["Week 28", "Baby has hair and can open eyes; high chance of survival if born now."],
    ["Week 37–40", "Baby fully developed and ready to be born; ~520mm; rotates head-down."],

    // Maternal lifestyle effects
    ["Placenta transfer", "Oxygen and nutrients (e.g., glucose) pass from mother to foetus across the placenta."],
    ["Alcohol (pregnancy)", "Can cross placenta; increases risk of miscarriage/stillbirth/premature birth/low birthweight; heavy drinking can cause foetal alcohol syndrome."],
    ["Smoking (pregnancy)", "Increases risk of miscarriage, stillbirth or SIDS; babies more likely premature/low birthweight; reduced oxygen can affect brain development."]
